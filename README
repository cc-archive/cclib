The idea here is to have some common place for code for dealing with 
CC licensing that can be re-used in many different places. Currently, this
is spread all over, so now we can hopefully start to locate it all together.

To create a new place for your code, like something in JAVA, please create
a new folder with the simple name for the language, like /java. Then, start
throwing your code in there...let's go!


Oh, if including this full module on a website and there is non-web executable
code, then please add some .htaccess to the folders that shouldn't be 
executed. That will provide some level of deny.

This should be done like this in an .htaccess file:

# This should be a file in the folder you want access denied to...
DENY from all
#END OF FILE
